    <h4>Jersey</h4>
    <p>Nice entertaining movie with a mature theme. Liked acting of all lead artists. Aspiration of young Indian youth is brought out nicely. May not be a true story but the plot brings out right theme for many dedicated and aspiring young Indian cricketers, particularly from southern part of India. Thoughtful theme for cricket loving nation fighting for recognition through hard work.</p>
